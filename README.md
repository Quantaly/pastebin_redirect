# pastebin_redirect

Redirects people who visit the page to the link contained in the provided [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/).

Example usage:

[`https://quantumassembly.github.io/pastebin_redirect/#JX1twguA`](https://quantumassembly.github.io/pastebin_redirect/#JX1twguA)

Note that this does not redirect HTTP requests, all redirection is done in JS by the browser. This means that it doesn't work for non-browser clients, which are probably better off accessing Pastebin themselves.
